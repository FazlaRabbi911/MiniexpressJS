# MiniExpress.js

A minimal version of Express.js built with raw Node.js â€” designed to help understand how web frameworks work behind the scenes.

## ðŸš€ Why I Built This

While learning backend development, I wanted to understand what happens under the hood of frameworks like Express. So I challenged myself to build my own HTTP server with basic routing, file serving, and JSON response capabilities.

##  Features

- Custom routing system with `.route(method, path, handler)`
- Static file serving (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- JSON response utility with `.sendJson()`
- Lightweight and clean architecture (no hardcoded logic inside the framework)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ style.css
â””â”€â”€ script.js

##  Demo Feature

Includes a mini front-end project where clicking a button randomly switches between images served from different routes using your custom MiniExpress server.

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/miniexpress.git
cd miniexpress
